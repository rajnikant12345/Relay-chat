# Chat Server
Its a TLS based server which allows a secure communication between multiple clients,   
this server just act on messages suppplied. And it's a dumb server which just forwards   
messages from one client to other. 

I will implement message flows one by one and update this document.

## Functionalities
I am planning following functionalities in initial release. Then we will see, where  
it goes.
1. User registration
2. Login
3. Key exchange
4. Text Messaging ( Plain and Encrypted )

## Messaging Flow

```
Every request and response from server will consist of unique reference   
id generated by server and clinet need to pass that reference id to server.  
Otherwise surver will not allow you to communicate and will terminate the  
connection. This will avoid hijacking of our channels.

```

### Register 
1. Send Registration Request.
2. Server will save, registration information into database.

### Login
1. Send login request.
2. Server will return you a jwt.
3. Use this jwt for further communication.
